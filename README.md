## The Challenge

This is a .NET 9 Blazor Web App with global server interactivity.

We want to add the idea of "breadcrumbs" to the app, implementing a "Back" button in every screen that takes us back to where we came from.

The browser back button is not enough. We want to give our user a chance to save changes. We also want to make sure that we can go multiple steps back, not just one step.

How can we achieve this?
